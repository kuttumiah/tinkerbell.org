# Tinkerbell

For complete documentation visit [tinkerbell.org](https://tinkerbell.org/)

Tinkerbell is a bare metal provisioning engine.
Itâ€™s built and maintained with love by the team at Equinix Metal.

This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style!
This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.
